 Normally, a power system operates under balanced conditions. When the system becomes unbalanced due to the failures of insulation at any point or due to the contact of live wires, a shortâ€“circuit or fault, is said to occur in the line. Faults may occur in the power system due to the number of reasons like natural disturbances (lightning, high-speed winds, earthquakes), insulation breakdown, falling of a tree, bird shorting, etc.

This application enables field workers to inspect faults in electrical lines. They are required to input current and voltage values in order to obtain a projected fault type.
